* This bot fetches the daily lunch + snack menu of a certain municipal day care unit, City of SeinÃ¤joki.
* Daily rss feed is parsed, saved locally and sent to a personal email address.
* Secrets are stored in Vault.
* The code contains a lot of commented sections. Those are placeholders myself if rpaframework supports >= 4.0 Tweepy in the future.
* At least I wasn't able to solve the dependency conflicts.
* One can choose another RSS link in the list of [menus](https://ruokalistat.seinajoki.fi/AromieMenus/FI/Default/tervetuloa).

# Might as well leave the Robocorp minimal template readme content here
This template leverages the new Python open-source structure [robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robo), the [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robo#libraries) from to same project as well. The full power of [rpaframework](https://github.com/robocorp/rpaframework) is also available for you on Python as a backup while we implement new Python libraries.
